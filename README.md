## Description

The Simon game challenges the player to remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of button presses. The game starts when the user presses any key. Each level adds a new random button to the sequence. The player must click the buttons in the correct order to progress. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and can be restarted by pressing any key.
